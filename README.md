# Covid Risk Assessment App

Note: The web service originally used in this application is no longer available. We are currently working on rewiring the application to work with another API that we built (See https://github.com/Jtwoolbright/Covid-Risk-App-Api ). 

## Features

With this app, you can

- Assess your risk for suffering severe Covid 19 symptoms
- Find vaccination locations near you
- Find emergency services near you
- Check to see if you have symptoms of Covid 19
